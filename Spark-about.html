                    <h2>Speed Training Made Easy</h2>
                    <p>Spark is a computer vision-based software that automatically times sprints from video footage. Using YOLO's pose estimation software, it can identify athletes and track there movements frame by frame. The timing's precision is wtihin 0.03 seconds and improves the efficiency of a speed training session.</p>

                    <p>The program outputs the audio graph show in the image. Comparing the second video with the fourth video, we can see the accuracy of the program. There are still improvements to be made on detecting when the runner crosses the finish line.</p>

                    <h2>How To Use</h2>
                    <p>Many features are yet to be implemented, but here is how it works for now.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Set camera up at finish line. Center the screen on the finish line.</li>
                        <li>Start recording.</li>
                        <li>Runner/coach/teammate gives audio cue, such as "GO".</li>
                        <li>Go!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The system works by first detecting the auditory cue, or the peak in audio. It then tracks the athlete through the finish line, and calculating the elapsed time from start to end.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="demo-description">
                    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                    <p>Currently, more than one person in the frame will lead to inaccurate results. There needs to be a way to mark the runner as the person we are following. Also, if the person giving the audio cue is not right by the phone, there will be a small error in time due to the speed of sound. The next major step will be to deploy the software. </p>
