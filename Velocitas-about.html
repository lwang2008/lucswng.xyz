                    <p>Building on top of Spark, I began trying to figure out which other data from the pose model could be analyzed. However, the inaccuracy of YOLO11's pose model makes it near impossible to implement features such as as a stride-frequency detector. I have tried to train YOLOv8's pose model by annotating images on Roboflow, but the time consuming nature of this process prompted me to delay it. I am currently in the process of learning other models from Tensorflow and OpenPose.</p>
