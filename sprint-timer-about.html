                    <h2>Project Background</h2>
                    <p>As both a student athlete and developer, I recognized the need for accurate sprint timing without requiring multiple people to operate stopwatches. The Sprint Timer project was born from this need - a tool that could automatically detect, track, and time sprinters using only video footage.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Traditional sprint timing methods are either:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manual (requiring human operators with stopwatches)</li>
                        <li>Expensive (professional timing systems)</li>
                        <li>Limited (not adaptable to different environments)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These limitations make it difficult for individual athletes, small teams, or schools to get accurate timing data without significant resources.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>The Sprint Timer uses computer vision and machine learning to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatically detect athletes in video footage</li>
                        <li>Track their movement throughout a sprint</li>
                        <li>Identify start and finish events</li>
                        <li>Calculate accurate sprint times</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of this is accomplished using a standard video camera or smartphone footage, making it accessible to anyone.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Development Process</h2>
                    <p>The development involved several key challenges:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Training YOLO to reliably detect athletes in various lighting conditions and environments</li>
                        <li>Creating algorithms to accurately determine start and finish moments</li>
                        <li>Developing audio processing to detect starting gun sounds</li>
                        <li>Building a user-friendly interface for analyzing results</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
                    <p>The Sprint Timer achieves timing accuracy within 0.1 seconds of professional systems, making it a viable alternative for training purposes. It has been used by my track team to analyze performance and has potential applications in coaching, athletic development, and sports science research.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Future Development</h2>
                    <p>Ongoing improvements include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mobile app development for real-time analysis</li>
                        <li>Support for multiple athlete tracking</li>
                        <li>Integration with wearable devices for additional metrics</li>
                        <li>Cloud-based storage and analysis of timing data</li>
                    </ul>
